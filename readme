prereqs:
python 2.7
django 1.5.0+ 

1. you will need a settings.py file. Run:

>cp example_settings.py pubdb/settings.py

Now edit pubdb/settings.py for your machine (this is not under version control b/c the settings depend on the machine). Specifically, the line:

'NAME': '/Users/pickrell/DB/testdb',                      # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.

needs to be edited to a database file on the local machine. This file will be created if it does not exist.

2. now run: 

>export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=pubdb.settings
>python manage.py syncdb
>python manage.py runserver
>python testdb.py
